    <p>Hi &#128075; ! My name is Ernest, a second-year journalism student at the University of Ottawa from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Whitby,+ON">Whitby, Ontario</a>. 
      I didn't grow up as the most athletic child, so I mostly surrounded myself with my nerdy friends, doing all nerdy things from Star Wars to videogames. </p>

    <p>I was in Grade 10 when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. Being under quarantine, I found a lot of comfort reading and watching 
      the news, learning about what was happening in and around my community, be that locally or nationally. 
      From the pandemic itself, the many debacles in American politics, to pop culture news with the release of the PS5 or the different shows 
      that released during that time, I found myself consuming a lot of news. 
      
      Around that time, my high school created its own student newspaper The Gator Gazette. I've included a link to the Instagram account 
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dawgatorgazette/"> here.</a> I had always been passionate about stories and writing. But I was no Stephen King. 
      When it was all said and done, going to school for journalism didn't just feel like a good idea, it felt like the only idea. </p>

    <p>I wanted to live in one of Canada's major cities, but growing up in Toronto, I wanted the chance to move out. So, I went to uOttawa for their joint program with 
      Algonquin College for Digital Journalism!</p>

    <p>I've only just started my second year, but I'm very optimistic about this one because my freshman year went really well! Not only did I find my footing in a new 
      city, I found new opportunities and even started building my journalist portfolio. Here's a link to one of my first pieces.
